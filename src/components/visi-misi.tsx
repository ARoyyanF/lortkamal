              The airborne terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, the
              Pentagon, and the thwarted flight against the White House or
              Capitol on September 11, 2001, in which nearly 3,000 Americans
              were killed, transformed George W. Bush into a wartime president.
              The attacks put on hold many of Bush’s hopes and plans, and Bush’s
              father, George Bush, the 41st president, declared that his son
              “faced the greatest challenge of any president since Abraham
              Lincoln.” In response, Bush formed a new cabinet-level Department
              of Homeland Security, sent American forces into Afghanistan to
              break up the Taliban, a movement under Osama bin Laden that
              trained financed and exported terrorist teams. The Taliban was
              successfully disrupted but Bin Laden was not captured and was
              still on the loose as Bush began his second term. Following the
              attacks, the president also recast the nation’s intelligence
              gathering and analysis services, and ordered reform of the
              military forces to meet the new enemy. At the same time he
              delivered major tax cuts which had been a campaign pledge. His
              most controversial act was the invasion of Iraq on the belief that
              Iraqi President Saddam Hussein posed a grave threat to the United
              States. Saddam was captured, but the disruption of Iraq and the
              killing of American servicemen and friendly Iraqis by insurgents
              became the challenge of Bush’s government as he began his second
              term. President Bush pledged during his 2005 State of the Union
              Address that the United States would help the Iraqi people
              establish a fully democratic government because the victory of
              freedom in Iraq would strengthen a new ally in the war on terror,
              bring hope to a troubled region, and lift a threat from the lives
              of future generations.
